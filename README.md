[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Cake.VsixSignTool.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.VsixSignTool)

## Requirements
* 1.4.0

    - Cake 4.0.0
    - .net 6+

* 1.3.0: 

  - Cake 0.33 or later

* 1.2.0: 

  * Cake 0.28 or later

  * BREAKING change: VSIX tool is now decoupled from adding, you have to add it manually to cake script, like

    `#tool nuget:?package=Microsoft.VSSDK.Vsixsigntool`

* 1.0.0: Latest package is referencing Cake 0.22 or later.

## Including addin
Including addin in cake script is easy.
```
#addin "Cake.VsixSignTool"
```

## Usage

To use the addin just add it to Cake call the aliases and configure any settings you want.

```csharp
#tool nuget:?package=Microsoft.VSSDK.Vsixsigntool
#addin "Cake.VsixSignTool"
Task("Sign")
    .Does(() => 
    {
        VsixSignToolSign(new VsixSignToolSignSettings { 
            File = "test.pfx", 
            Hash="...some hash",
            Password = "PASSWORD"
            }, 
         "MyVsixPackage.vsix");
    });
...
```

Either string or FilePath can be used to pass target files.

# General Notes
